1. All the action names mentioned as static, so moved to an enum.
2. Initialized form in ngOnInit (BookSearchComponent)
3. Removed unused declaration/methods - removed onOnInit() from (TotalCountComponent)



## Accessability Issues

1. Aria-label is missing for image tags
2. alternate text is missing for image tags
3. Books List header name, and book info is not reading by screen readers
4. tab sequence is not in proper order
